  By not providing "Findcommunication.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "communication", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "communication"

  Add the installation prefix of "communication" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set

  "communication" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
